1. **Highest Overall Score**: {top_method[1]['methodology_name']} ({top_method[1]['ranking_score']})
2. **Best Contextual Fit**: {contextual_best[1]['methodology']} (Contextual Score: {contextual_best[1]['score']})
3. **Integration Opportunities**: {len(integrations)} promising combinations identified
4. **Risk Mitigation**: All methodologies have identified risks with specific mitigation strategies

## Recommendations

Based on this analysis:

1. **Primary Recommendation**: {top_method[1]['methodology_name']} offers the best overall balance of feasibility, alignment, and potential
2. **Contextual Consideration**: {contextual_best[1]['methodology']} shows strongest contextual fit for ACP/A2A DER research
3. **Integration Strategy**: Consider combination approaches to leverage complementary strengths
4. **Risk Management**: Implement identified mitigation strategies early in methodology selection

## Next Steps

- Task 5.2.3: Assess detailed resource requirements for top methodologies
- Task 5.2.4: Analyze implementation feasibility within thesis constraints
- Task 5.3.1: Select primary methodology based on comprehensive evaluation
