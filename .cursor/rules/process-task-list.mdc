# Task List Management

Guidelines for managing task lists in markdown files to track progress on completing a PRD. All directories mentioned below are with respective to the root folder of the repository.

_Note: In this specific project, the document serving as the PRD is under `sources/1.0-course_material/` censored for privacy._

## AI Instructions

When working with task lists, the AI must:

1. Read the referenced task file under `task/`, to identify the next step. Read the most recent task output under `docs/` and check whether the next step is what should be done

2. **Before Task Execution - MUST read the contexts:**
    - Read the most recent entry in `tools/`, `sources/` and `docs/`
    - If few (<3) files are read, use recency pattern:
        - Fetch associated files using task number, not full name
        - For task X.Y.Z:
            1. X.Y.Z-1 (most recent)
            2. ...X.Y.1
            3. X.Y-1.*
            4. ...X.1.*
            7. X-1.*.*
        - Stop when an additional context would not change the execution
    - Reading `docs/`, use recursive pattern:
        - If the name of a prior doc is mentioned in the contents of a files you are reading, read the prior doc
        - Fetch associated files using full name
        - Stop when an additional context would not change the execution
    - Read PRD if:
        - Required context is not found in recent dependencies
        - Task has direct PRD requirements
        - Task is a major milestone or deliverable
    - Read `archive/X.Y.Z-.../README.md`if exists

3. **During Task Execution - output results:**
    - When working with a directory, a list, or a set of data, you must create a script under `tools/` to ensure they can be completed one chunk at a time with minimal contexts
    - When data processing requires a set of categories or rules, you must create a script under `tools/` to ensure they can be completed one rule at a time with minimal contexts
    - Respond in chat explicitly why a script isn't used
    - When output text uses contexts that involves citations to sources, cite the sources, as this retains connection with external literature
    - Output file locations:
        - `tools/` - Scripts and utilities
        - `sources/` - Input data or results of using scripts
        - `docs/` - Output files or results of analyzing sources
        - `deliverables/` - Output for tasks marked with (Deliverable)
    - Output file under `docs/` must indicate the exact files or directories of the sources and tools used to generate its results
    - Output directories under `docs/` must be accompanied by an output markdown directly under `docs/` 
    - Output file naming must start with the associated task number

4. **After Task Execution - task management:**
    - Mark only the task you are working on with `[x]`
    - If all subtasks under parent are `[x]`, mark parent `[x]`
    - New tasks should not be created unless directed by another .mdc
    - **One sub-task at a time:** Do **NOT** start executing the next task until you ask the user for permission and they say “yes” or "y"
