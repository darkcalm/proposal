# Task List Management

Guidelines for managing task lists in markdown files to track progress on completing a PRD. All directories mentioned below are with respective to the root folder of the repository.

_Note: In this specific project, the document serving as the PRD is `docs/1.2.3-project-charter.md`._

## AI Instructions

When working with task lists, the AI must:

1. **Initiation or After Task Execution - task management:**
    - If all subtasks under parent are `[x]`, mark parent `[x]`
    - **One sub-task at a time:** Do not mark the task you are working on with `[x]` and executing the next task until you have examined progess and have asked the user for permission and they say “yes” or "y"
    - New tasks should not be created until you have examined progess and have asked the user for permission and they say “yes” or "y"

2. **Before Task Execution - MUST read at least these contexts:**
    - Read the file names of all first-layer files or directories under `tools/`, `sources/` and `docs/`
    - Read the files with the current task number and prior (given X.Y.Z, **All of** X.Y.Z, X.Y.Z-1, X.Y-1.latest) under `docs/`
    - If any prior file in `docs/` is mentioned during any reading, also read the prior file
    - Stop when most additional contexts does not change the execution
    - You may add contexts based on association with the file names under `tools/`, `sources/` and `docs/`
    - Read PRD if:
        - No prior file is mentioned during reading
        - Task is a X.0 or marked with `(Deliverable)`
    - Read `archive/X.Y.Z-.../README.md` if exists

3. **During Task Execution - output results:**
    - Unless stated, **You** are the implementor, not the human user
    - When working with a directory, a list, or a set of data, you must create a script under `tools/` to ensure each detail is sequentially fulfilled
    - When data processing requires a set of categories or rules, you must create a script under `tools/` to ensure each detail is sequentially fulfilled
    - When a citations is made, where the external litature can be seen, you must cite the external source over our own texts
    - Output file locations:
        - `tools/` - Scripts and utilities
        - `sources/` - Input or outputs of scripts and utilities
        - `docs/` - Results of analyzing sources or other files under docs
        - `deliverables/` - Output for tasks marked with (Deliverable)
    - Output file under `docs/` must indicate the exact files or directories of the sources and tools used to generate its results
    - Output directories under `docs/` must be accompanied by an output markdown directly under `docs/` 
    - Output file naming must start with the associated task number
    - Unless stated, do not edit files that has an older task number
