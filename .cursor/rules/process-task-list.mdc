# Task List Management

Guidelines for managing task lists in markdown files to track progress on completing a PRD

_Note: In this specific project, the document serving as the PRD is under `sources/1.0-course_material/` censored for privacy._

## AI Instructions

When working with task lists, the AI must:

1. Read the file with the list of tasks, aware of overall progress. Read the most recent task output under `docs/`, and compare consistency to determine what the next subtask should be.

2. **Before Task Execution - acquire contexts:**
   - MUST read the contexts:
     - Look in `tools/`, `sources/` and `docs/` directories
     - For `sources/` and `docs/`, Follow recency pattern for task numbers:
       - For task X.Y.Z, check dependencies in order:
         1. X.Y.Z-1 (most recent)
         2. ...X.Y.1
         3. X.Y-1.*
         4. ...X.1.*
         7. X-1.*.*
       - If a document from a previous task is mentioned in a recent context, read recursively
       - If a keyword from the current task is mentioned in the name of `docs/` files, read them
       - Stop dependency chain when no additional context would change the execution
     - Check PRD if:
       - Required context is not found in recent dependencies
       - Task has direct PRD requirements
       - Task is a major milestone or deliverable

3. **During Task Execution - output results:**
   - When working with a directory, a list, or a set of data, you must create a script under `tools/` to ensure they can be completed one chunk at a time with minimal contexts
   - When data processing requires a set of categories or rules, you must create a script under `tools/` to ensure they can be completed one rule at a time with minimal contexts
   - Respond in chat explicitly why a script isn't used
   - When output text uses contexts that involves citations to sources, cite the sources, as this retains the connection between external literature and this work 
   - Output file locations:
     - `tools/` - Scripts and utilities
     - `sources/` - Input data or results of using scripts
     - `docs/` - Output files or results of analyzing sources
     - `deliverables/` - Output for tasks marked with (Deliverable)
   - Output file under `docs/` must indicate the exact files or directories of the sources and tools used to generate its results
   - Output directories under `docs/` must be accompanied by an output markdown directly under `docs/` 
   - Output file naming must start with the associated task number

4. **After Task Execution - task management:**
   - Mark only the task you are working on with `[x]`
   - If all subtasks under parent are `[x]`, mark parent `[x]`
   - New tasks should not be created unless directed by another .mdc
   - **One sub-task at a time:** Do **NOT** start executing the next subtask until you ask the user for permission and they say “yes” or "y"
