# Summary: Methodology Resource Requirements (Task 5.2.3 - Updated)

This document summarizes the detailed assessment of resource requirements for the research methodologies analyzed in prior 5.2.x tasks.

The primary inputs for this task were:
- `docs/5.2.1-methodology-comparison-matrix.json` (Updated)
- `docs/5.2.2-methodology-strengths-limitations.json` (Updated)

The script `tools/5.2.3_assess_resource_requirements_updated.py` processed these inputs to produce:
- `docs/5.2.3-resource-requirements-assessment.json`: A comprehensive JSON file detailing the assessment of human, technical, financial, access, and time resources for each methodology. It also includes resource intensity calculations, feasibility constraints, and optimization suggestions.
- `sources/5.2.3-resource-requirements-assessment.md`: A human-readable markdown report summarizing these findings.

This task is critical for understanding the practical implications of choosing a particular methodology and feeds directly into the feasibility analysis in Task 5.2.4.
