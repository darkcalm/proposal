# 8.1.6 Research Clarification Changes Summary

**Document Purpose:** This document systematically captures all changes made to the main research proposal document (`deliverable/main.tex`) to clarify the research focus and resolve terminology confusion after completing gap analysis sections 4.3.3-4.3.5.

**Date:** January 2025  
**Context:** Post gap analysis refinement phase  
**Rationale:** Address terminology confusion between general "Agent Communication Protocols" and specific ACP protocol; clarify research aims focus on digital twin creation rather than direct coordination improvement.

---

## 1. TERMINOLOGY STANDARDIZATION

### 1.1 Core Terminology Change
**Issue Identified:** The use of "Agent Communication Protocols" in the title and throughout the document created confusion with the specific Agent Communication Protocol (ACP) that is one of the protocols being studied.

**Resolution:** Systematically replaced "Agent Communication Protocols" with "Agent Protocol Primitives" throughout the document.

**Rationale:** "Agent Protocol Primitives" better emphasizes:
- The foundational, building-block nature of the protocols
- The compositional and developmental aspects of the research
- Clear distinction from the specific ACP protocol being studied
- Focus on fundamental components used to build new solutions

### 1.2 Specific Terminology Replacements Made

| Original Term | Replaced With | Context |
|---------------|---------------|---------|
| "Agent Communication Protocols" | "Agent Protocol Primitives" | Title, abstract, section headers |
| "agent communication protocols" | "agent protocol primitives" | Body text references |
| "Agent Communication Protocol literature" | "agent protocol primitive literature" | Individual contributions section |

## 2. TITLE EVOLUTION

### 2.1 Initial Title Problem
**Original:** "Agent Communication Protocols for Human Expertise Coordination in Distributed Energy Resource Operations"

**Issues:**
- Confusion with specific ACP protocol
- Suggests direct aim is coordination improvement
- Misalignment with actual research focus on digital twin creation

### 2.2 Title Refinement Process
**Intermediate:** "Agent Protocol Primitives for Human Expertise Coordination in Distributed Energy Resource Operations"

**Final:** "Agent Protocol Primitives for Digital Twins of Human Operators in Distributed Energy Resource Systems"

**Improvements:**
- Eliminates ACP terminology confusion
- Clearly states research focus on digital twin creation
- Aligns with abstract content about creating HDTs
- Emphasizes human operator modeling rather than coordination outcomes

---

## 3. RESEARCH AIM CLARIFICATION

### 3.1 Core Research Focus Realignment

**Issue:** Language throughout the document suggested the research directly aimed to improve coordination rather than create digital twins that could enable coordination.

**Resolution:** Systematic clarification that:
- **Primary aim:** Create digital twins of human operators using agent protocol primitives
- **Secondary/potential outcomes:** These digital twins could then enable better coordination

### 3.2 Specific Research Aim Changes

#### 3.2.1 Overall Research Aim
**Before:**
```
This research aims to develop and validate a framework for creating Human DER Worker Digital Twins (HDTs) using agent protocol primitives to effectively model, preserve, and scale human expertise in Distributed Energy Resource management and operational coordination.
```

**After:**
```
This research aims to develop and validate a framework for creating Human DER Worker Digital Twins (HDTs) using agent protocol primitives to effectively model, preserve, and scale human expertise in Distributed Energy Resource management operations.
```

**Change:** Removed "and operational coordination" to focus purely on expertise modeling.

#### 3.2.2 Abstract Modification
**Before:**
```
...enabling more effective operational knowledge coordination across distributed energy systems.
```

**After:**
```
...potentially enabling more effective operational knowledge management across distributed energy systems.
```

**Change:** Added "potentially" and changed "coordination" to "management" to clarify this is an outcome, not the direct aim.

## 4. RESEARCH QUESTIONS REFINEMENT

### 4.1 Overarching Research Question (ORQ)
**Before:**
```
How can agent protocol primitives (specifically MCP, ACP, and A2A) be adapted and integrated with Digital Twin principles to create Human DER Worker Digital Twins that effectively model, preserve, and scale human expertise, thereby addressing operational challenges...
```

**After:**
```
How can agent protocol primitives (specifically MCP, ACP, and A2A) be adapted and integrated with Digital Twin principles to create Human DER Worker Digital Twins that effectively model, preserve, and scale human expertise, potentially addressing operational challenges...
```

**Change:** "thereby addressing" → "potentially addressing" to clarify these are potential outcomes.

### 4.2 Specific Research Question 2 (SRQ2)
**Before:**
```
How can different agent protocol architectures be effectively mapped and implemented to model various Human DER Worker coordination models within specific DER Application Contexts such as operational knowledge management and stakeholder coordination?
```

**After:**
```
How can different agent protocol architectures be effectively mapped and implemented to model various Human DER Worker expertise patterns within specific DER Application Contexts such as operational knowledge management and stakeholder interaction?
```

**Changes:**
- "coordination models" → "expertise patterns"
- "stakeholder coordination" → "stakeholder interaction"
- Focus shifted from coordination improvement to expertise pattern modeling

## 5. OBJECTIVES CLARIFICATION

### 5.1 Objective 2 Refinement
**Before:**
```
Design and evaluate protocol-enabled HDT architectures that can model various Human DER Worker coordination patterns while maintaining dynamic interaction with both application and evaluation contexts.
```

**After:**
```
Design and evaluate protocol-enabled HDT architectures that can model various Human DER Worker expertise patterns within specific DER Application Contexts such as operational knowledge management and stakeholder interaction.
```

**Rationale:** Shift focus from coordination patterns to expertise patterns, making clear the research models human knowledge rather than improves coordination directly.

## 6. SCOPE AND LIMITATIONS ADJUSTMENTS

### 6.1 Use Case Specificity Clarification
**Before:**
```
The research focuses solely on the operational knowledge coordination use case for DERs.
```

**After:**
```
The research focuses solely on modeling human operational expertise for DERs through digital twins.
```

**Improvement:** Clearly states what the research actually does (modeling expertise) rather than what it aims to achieve (coordination).

## 7. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK UPDATES

### 7.1 Application Context Redefinition
**Before:**
```
Application Context (DER Operational Knowledge Management & Coordination)
```

**After:**
```
Application Context (DER Operational Knowledge Management)
```

**Change:** Removed "& Coordination" to focus on knowledge management as the direct context.

### 7.2 Framework Contributions Clarification
**Before:**
```
This framework addresses identified theoretical gaps in agent protocol composition for human-centric coordination and dynamic human-AI collaboration models...
```

**After:**
```
