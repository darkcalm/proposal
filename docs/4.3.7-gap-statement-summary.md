# Summary of Preliminary Gap Statement Formulation

This document outlines the process and results of formulating a preliminary research gap statement, drawing from the analyses of theoretical gaps, methodological limitations, and practical needs identified in the literature.

## Process

The preliminary gap statement was synthesized using the Python script `tools/4.3.7_formulate_gap_statement.py`. This script aggregates key findings from the following source documents:

- `sources/4.3.4-theoretical-gaps.md`
- `sources/4.3.5-methodological-limitations.md`
- `sources/4.3.6-practical-needs.md`

The script extracts a limited number of key points (paper name, keyword, and brief context) from each of these source files to provide a structured overview. It then presents these summaries and provides a template for formulating a combined gap statement.

## Preliminary Gap Statement Output

The synthesized output, which includes summaries of the identified gaps and a template for the preliminary gap statement, is located in:

- [`sources/4.3.7-preliminary-gap-statement.md`](../../sources/4.3.7-preliminary-gap-statement.md)

This output provides a structured starting point. The placeholders `[Synthesize 1-2 key theoretical themes from section 1]`, etc., within the `sources/4.3.7-preliminary-gap-statement.md` file will require manual review and synthesis to create a coherent and concise gap statement.

## Relevance to Project and Next Steps

This step (Task 4.3.7) is critical for defining the precise focus of the research. The preliminary gap statement will serve as a foundation for refining the research questions and objectives.

**Next Steps:**
- Manually review and synthesize the themes in `sources/4.3.7-preliminary-gap-statement.md` to complete the gap formulation.
- Use this formulated gap to refine research questions and objectives for the proposal, ensuring alignment with the project charter (`docs/1.2.3-project-charter.md`) and the identified landscape of AI Agent Protocols.
