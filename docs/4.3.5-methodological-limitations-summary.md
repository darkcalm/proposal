# Summary of Identified Methodological Limitations

This document summarizes the methodological limitations identified from the literature review process, specifically from the markdown files located in `sources/4.3.1-elicit-results/markdown_papers/`.

## Process

The methodological limitations were identified using the Python script `tools/4.3.5_map_methodological_limitations.py`. This script scans the markdown-converted papers for a predefined set of keywords and phrases associated with limitations in research design, data collection, analysis, and validation.

Keywords used for identification include (but are not limited to):
- "methodological limitation"
- "study limitation"
- "methodological challenge"
- "research design issue"
- "validation issue"
- "lack of method"

## Detailed Findings

The detailed list of identified methodological limitations, including the source paper, the keyword that triggered the identification, and the context of the limitation, can be found in the following file:

- [`sources/4.3.5-methodological-limitations.md`](../../sources/4.3.5-methodological-limitations.md)

## Relevance to Project

Understanding these methodological limitations (Task 4.3.5) is crucial for designing a robust research methodology for this project (ILO3). It helps in avoiding previously identified pitfalls and in selecting or developing methods that can address these limitations, especially concerning the study of AI Agent Protocols as per `docs/1.2.3-project-charter.md`.
