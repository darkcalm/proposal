# Summary: Methodology Feasibility Analysis (Task 5.2.4 - Updated)

This document summarizes the comprehensive feasibility analysis conducted for the research methodologies, building upon the outputs of Tasks 5.2.1, 5.2.2, and 5.2.3.

The primary inputs for this task were:
- `docs/5.2.1-methodology-comparison-matrix.json` (Updated)
- `docs/5.2.2-methodology-strengths-limitations.json` (Updated)
- `docs/5.2.3-resource-requirements-assessment.json` (Updated)

The script `tools/5.2.4_analyze_feasibility_updated.py` processed these inputs to produce:
- `docs/5.2.4-feasibility-analysis.json`: A detailed JSON file containing the feasibility score, category, and recommendation for each methodology, along with a breakdown of contributing factors (suitability, resource feasibility, risk, timeline alignment).
- `sources/5.2.4-feasibility-analysis.md`: A human-readable markdown report summarizing the feasibility rankings and detailing the analysis for the top methodologies.

This feasibility analysis is the culmination of the methodology evaluation phase (Task 5.2) and directly informs the selection of the primary methodology in Task 5.3.
