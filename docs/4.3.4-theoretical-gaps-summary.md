# Summary of Identified Theoretical Gaps

This document summarizes the theoretical gaps identified from the literature review process, specifically from the markdown files located in `sources/4.3.1-elicit-results/markdown_papers/`.

## Process

The theoretical gaps were identified using the Python script `tools/4.3.4_identify_theoretical_gaps.py`. This script scans the markdown-converted papers for a predefined set of keywords and phrases associated with theoretical limitations, challenges, and unexplored areas.

Keywords used for identification include (but are not limited to):
- "theoretical gap"
- "conceptual limitation"
- "theoretical challenge"
- "unexplored theory"
- "lack of theory"
- "theoretical framework needs"

## Detailed Findings

The detailed list of identified theoretical gaps, including the source paper, the keyword that triggered the identification, and the context of the gap, can be found in the following file:

- [`sources/4.3.4-theoretical-gaps.md`](../../sources/4.3.4-theoretical-gaps.md)

## Relevance to Project

This analysis is crucial for fulfilling Task 4.3.4 and contributes to the overall research problem formulation by highlighting areas where existing theories may be insufficient or require further development, particularly in the context of AI Agent Protocols as outlined in the project charter (`docs/1.2.3-project-charter.md`). The findings will inform the subsequent steps in the research gap analysis.
