# Summary of Identified Practical Needs

This document summarizes the practical needs identified from the literature review process, specifically from the markdown files located in `sources/4.3.1-elicit-results/markdown_papers/`.

## Process

The practical needs were identified using the Python script `tools/4.3.6_document_practical_needs.py`. This script scans the markdown-converted papers for a predefined set of keywords and phrases associated with industry requirements, real-world applications, operational challenges, and unmet practical needs. For ambiguous terms like "future work," context validation was performed to ensure relevance to practical applications.

Keywords used for identification include (but are not limited to):
- "practical need"
- "industry requirement"
- "real-world application"
- "operational challenge"
- "unmet need"
- "need for tool/framework"

## Detailed Findings

The detailed list of identified practical needs, including the source paper, the keyword that triggered the identification, and the context of the need, can be found in the following file:

- [`sources/4.3.6-practical-needs.md`](../../sources/4.3.6-practical-needs.md)

## Relevance to Project

Identifying these practical needs (Task 4.3.6) helps in grounding the research in real-world problems and ensures that the proposed solutions or investigations have tangible benefits. This is particularly important for aligning the project with industry demands and practical challenges in the domain of AI Agent Protocols, as emphasized in `docs/1.2.3-project-charter.md`.
