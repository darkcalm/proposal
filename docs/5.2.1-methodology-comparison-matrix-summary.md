# Summary: Methodology Comparison Matrix (Task 5.2.1 - Updated)

This document summarizes the generation of the comprehensive methodology comparison matrix, which systematically evaluates identified research methodologies based on data consolidated from Task 5.1.x series.

The primary input for this task was `docs/5.1.1-relevant-methodologies.json`.

The key outputs generated by `tools/5.2.1_create_comparison_matrix_updated.py` are:
- `docs/5.2.1-methodology-comparison-matrix.json`: Detailed comparison data, including augmented methodology details, evaluation criteria, and scores.
- `sources/5.2.1-methodology-comparison-matrix.md`: A human-readable markdown summary of the comparison table and key findings.
- `sources/5.2.1-methodology-comparison-matrix.csv`: A CSV version of the comparison table for data analysis.

This task forms a crucial step in evaluating and selecting an appropriate research methodology by providing a structured and scored comparison based on predefined criteria relevant to the research context.
