# Preliminary Research Gap Statement

This document synthesizes identified gaps from the literature to formulate a preliminary research gap statement. It draws upon analyses of theoretical gaps, methodological limitations, and practical needs highlighted in the reviewed papers.

The source files for this synthesis are:

- Methodological Limitations: `4.3.5-methodological-limitations.md`
- Practical Needs: `4.3.6-practical-needs.md`

## 1. Summary of Identified Theoretical Gaps
The literature review points to several areas where theoretical underpinnings may be lacking or require further development. Key points include:
- No specific points extracted.

## 2. Summary of Identified Methodological Limitations
Existing research exhibits certain methodological limitations that could be addressed. Key points include:
- **Sociotechnical_Safety_Evaluation_of_Generative_AI_Systems.md** (Keyword: `methodological limitation`): th defining the metrics. In this section, we describe available methods for measuring risks of harm from generative AI systems at each of the three la...

## 4. Preliminary Gap Formulation
Based on the synthesis above, a preliminary research gap can be formulated. This research aims to address the confluence of:
- **Theoretical Gaps:** [Synthesize 1-2 key theoretical themes from section 1]
- **Methodological Limitations:** [Synthesize 1-2 key methodological themes from section 2]
- **Practical Needs:** [Synthesize 1-2 key practical themes from section 3]

Specifically, there is an opportunity to [describe the proposed research focus that addresses these combined gaps, e.g., 'develop a novel framework for X that overcomes identified theoretical and methodological limitations to meet the practical need for Y in the context of AI Agent Protocols']. Further refinement of this statement will be undertaken based on these initial findings.
