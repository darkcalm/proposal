th defining the metrics. In this section, we describe available methods for measuring risks of harm from generative AI systems at each of the three layers of evaluation. For each method, we provide examples of sociotechnical evaluations, and discuss **methodological limitation**s in appendix section A.2. 4.2.1. Capability evaluation methods To assess model capabilities, practitioners may leverage automated evaluations that assess performance against fixed datasets or tasks. Alternatively, human annotation can evaluate AI sy
