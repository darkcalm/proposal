However, the paper lacks in-depth technology implementation discussions and doesn’t fully explore dynamic evolution. The presented case study is relatively simple, suggesting **future work** should focus on more complex systems to validate the model further. • Reported energy efficiency improvements: Improve chiller’s coefficient of perfor- mance (COP) by manipulating the chiller setpoints more intelligently. • Reported benefits: Lower management and operational cost, less energy co

case study conducted in a historic building demonstrated that a digital twin reflecting the building’s real-time status can be generated using sensor data. Insights from the digital twin were used to improve the indoor environment of the building for both heritage preservation and human comfort. **Future work** could involve using monitored indoor conditions to estimate occupancy levels and incor- porating additional data, such as energy consumption, to model energy behavior and reduce operational costs of historic buildings. --- Page 18 --- Page 18 of 31 Cespedes‑Cubides and Jradi ﻿Energy Informat

During the analysis, we noticed that many layers of the digital twin still lack more consistency in deﬁnitions, tools, and applications to allow more **real-world application**s. This starts with the lack of consensus for the term deﬁnition itself, which may lead to a misuse of terminology and impacting how other layers are deﬁned and implemented. Moving to the implementation, the gaps found about the lack of focus on detailed architecture and framework, security, stakeho
